# Assignment 1: GAN

## Assignment Details

1. Train a DCGAN on a dataset of your choice and document:
    1. The loss curve (for all types of losses)
    2. The minimum error observed
2. Add layers to the model such that you can achieve an increase in accuracy (decrease in error) of at least 5% and again document:
    1. The loss curve
    2. The minimum error obtained
3. Collate a sample of generated images from both iterations (1. & 2.) and note the differences or similarities you see in both images.

## Repository Structure

- One Python notebook containing all run codes and comments in .ipynb format and one in .pdf form.
